# get_post_api

The parts of project
- `app.py ` - server code
- `database.py ` is the code of functions accessing the database. The functions of this file should be called from the functions`app.py `.

Thus, we will consider the server as the entry point to the application, and the functions interacting with the database as auxiliary ones that are used at the entry point where necessary.
